I am Erwan Meunier, a PhD student at UCLouvain in the ICTEAM institute. My research focuses on online optimization and performance estimation problems, aiming to assess the performance of cutting-edge optimization algorithms. I also have a strong background and keen interest in combinatorial optimization and operations research in general. In addition, I am actively involved in and supportive of the open-source community.
